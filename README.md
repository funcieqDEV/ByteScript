# ByteScript

ByteScript is a programming language developed during a series of videos on the YouTube channel [Funcieq](https://www.youtube.com/@funcieq_).

## Overview

ByteScript is currently under development. This README provides a basic overview of its current syntax and features.

## Syntax Examples

### Comments

Single-line comments are denoted by `#`.

```bytescript
# This is a comment
```

### Variable Declaration

Variables are declared using a name and assigned a value. Types are inferred.

```bytescript
name = 15.0;
a = "test";
```

### Functions

Functions are defined using the `fun` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. The `ret` keyword is used to return a value.

```bytescript
fun add(a, b) {
    ret a + b;
}
```
